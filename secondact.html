  <p class="speech" >There is a shilling. No, keep the change.</p> <p>_[The PORTER thanks her, and
  goes out. NORA shuts the door. She is laughing to herself, as she takes
  off her hat and coat. She takes a packet of macaroons from her pocket
  and eats one or two; then goes cautiously to her husband’s door and
  listens.]_</p><p> Yes, he is in.</p>

  right]_</p>
  
  <h6 class="helmer">HELMER</h6>
  <p class="speech" >_[calls out from his room]_</p> <p>Is that my little lark twittering out
  there?</p>
  <h6 class="nora">NORA</h6>
  <p class="speech">_[busy opening some of the parcels]_</p><p>Yes, it is!</p>
  <h6 class="helmer">HELMER</h6>
  <p class="speech">Is it my little squirrel bustling about?</p>
  <h6 class="nora">NORA</h6>
  <p class="speech">Yes!</p>
  <h6 class="helmer">HELMER</h6>
  <p class="speech">When did my squirrel come home?</p>
  <h6 class="nora">NORA</h6>
  <p class="speech">Just now</p> 
  <p class="speech" >[Puts the bag of macaroons into her pocket and wipes her mouth.]_ </p>
  <p> Come in here, Torvald, and see what I have bought.</p>
  <h6 class="helmer">HELMER</h6>
  <p class="speech">Don’t disturb me</p> 
  <p  class="speech">[A little later, he opens the door and looks into the room, pen in hand.]</p>
  <p class="speech"> Bought, did you say? All these things? Has my
  little spendthrift been wasting money again?</p>
  <h6 class="nora">NORA</h6>
  <p class="speech">Yes but, Torvald, this year we really can let ourselves go a little.
  This is the first Christmas that we have not needed to economise.</p>
  <h6 class="helmer">HELMER</h6>
  <p class="speech">Still, you know, we can’t spend money recklessly.</p>
  <h6 class="nora">NORA</h6>
  <p class="speech">Yes, Torvald, we may be a wee bit more reckless now, mayn’t we? Just a
  tiny wee bit! You are going to have a big salary and earn lots and lots
  of money.</p>
  <h6 class="helmer">HELMER</h6>
  <p class="speech">Yes, after the New Year; but then it will be a whole quarter before the salary is due.</p>
  <h6 class="nora">NORA</h6>
  <p class="speech">Pooh! we can borrow until then.</p>
  <h6 class="helmer">HELMER</h6>
  <p class="speech">Nora! </p><p>[Goes up to her and takes her playfully by the ear.]_</p>
  <p class="speech"> The same
  little featherhead! Suppose, now, that I borrowed fifty pounds today,
  and you spent it all in the Christmas week, and then on New Year’s Eve
  a slate fell on my head and killed me, and—</p>
  <h6 class="nora">NORA</h6>
  <p class="speech" >_[putting her hands over his mouth]_.</p> 
  <p class="speech">Oh! don’t say such horrid things.</p>
  <h6 class="helmer">HELMER.</h6>
  <p class="speech">Still, suppose that happened,—what then?</p>
  <h6 class="nora">NORA</h6>
  <p class="speech">If that were to happen, I don’t suppose I should care whether I owed
  money or not.</p>
  <h6 class="helmer">HELMER</h6>
  <p class="speech">Yes, but what about the people who had lent it?</p>
  <h6 class="nora">NORA</h6>
  <p class="speech">They? Who would bother about them? I should not know who they were.</p>
  <h6 class="helmer">HELMER</h6>
  <p class="speech">That is like a woman! But seriously, Nora, you know what I think about
  that. No debt, no borrowing. There can be no freedom or beauty about a
  home life that depends on borrowing and debt. We two have kept bravely
  on the straight road so far, and we will go on the same way for the
  short time longer that there need be any struggle.</p>
